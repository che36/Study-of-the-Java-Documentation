
 Hello World Lesson

* Note: Type all code, commands, and file names exactly as shown. Both the compiler (javac) and launcher (java) are case-sensitive, so you must capitalize consistently.


* HelloWorldApp is not the same as helloworldapp


* Comments are ignored by the compiler but are useful to other programmers. The Java programming language supports three kinds of comments:

/* text */
The compiler ignores everything from /* to */.
/** documentation */
This indicates a documentation comment (doc comment, for short). The compiler ignores this kind of comment, just like it ignores comments that use /* and */. The javadoc tool uses doc comments when preparing automatically generated documentation. For more information on javadoc, see the Javadoc™ tool documentation .
// text
The compiler ignores everything from // to the end of the line.
